# difficult issue or bug

When attempting to delete a post by providing the user's key instead of the post's key, the system was not correctly identifying the user's intention, and the post was not being deleted as expected. This issue was causing confusion for users, as they were unsure whether to provide the post key or the user key for deletion

To resolve this bug and improve clarity for users, I made the following modifications:

 
- Updated the deletion endpoint to accept both post keys and user keys.
- Implemented logic to differentiate between the provided key types (post key or user key) and handle the deletion accordingly.
- Added clear documentation to the API endpoint specifying that users can provide either the post key or the user key for deletion, making it explicit    which key type is expected.
